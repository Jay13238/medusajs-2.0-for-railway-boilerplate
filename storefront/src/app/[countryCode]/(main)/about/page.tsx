      <p className="mb-10 text-primary">
        The Preparation Ministry is a self-supporting ministry dedicated to
        partnering with its local conference to reach people through public
        seminars and visual media. Over the past 11 years, God has abundantly
        blessed our efforts, allowing us to minister to more than 70 churches.
        Our sermons and health programs have been broadcast on five different
        Christian TV channels, expanding our outreach to a broader audience.

        Our mission focuses on helping people spiritually, mentally, and
        physically. We conduct seminars covering a wide range of topics,
        including spiritual growth, end-time events, emotional healing, health,
        cooking classes, marriage, parenting, and men's ministries. One of our
        most popular programs is the "Personality" series, which has received
        widespread acclaim. The ministry is led by Renier and Chantell Horn,
        along with their two sons, Jonathan and Matthew. With over a decade of
        ministry experience, Renier and Chantell have worked with three major
        conferences in South Africa.
